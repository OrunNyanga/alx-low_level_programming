Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a byte. C language is very efficient in manipulating bits.

One of the operators used to perform Bit manipulation are Bitwise operators.
Bitwise operators work on Bit and perform bit by bit operations, they are used to manipulate Bit size data.

Assuming B = 60; and B = 13; Now in binary format they will be as follows:

A = 0011 1100

B = 0000 1101
