We use malloc function to allocate memory during run time or execution of a program. When the statment is made, It requests a block of memory from the heap memory not stack. If there is enough memory left, the request will be granted, the required amount of memory will be reserved. Malloc will return a pointer/address to the reserved space.

Note: When the memory has been used and is no longer required, it is to be deallocated and returned to the operating system using the 'free' fuunction.
