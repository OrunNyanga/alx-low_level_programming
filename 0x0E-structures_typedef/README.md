The Typedef keyword is a content of C language that permits users to provide alternative names for the primitive (e.g.,​ int) and user-defined​ (e.g struct) data types.

Note: That this keyword (Typedef) simply gives a new name for some already existing data type but it does not grnt permission to create a new data type.
